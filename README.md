# KaziResort
Web application built for luxury resort companies.

# What I Learned
* How to have a flexible project structure that will be accepted by the community to contribute on
* How to develop components and inspect changes in the app that capture different states of the application
* How to develop reusable components to allow greater control and scalability for building more consistent experience for the users
